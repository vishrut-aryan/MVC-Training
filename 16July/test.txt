Giambattista Vico (1668-1744) was a philosopher opposed to Descartes rationalism. For Vico, we can only understand what we can make (verum ipsum factum), this means basically our own history and the mathematics. The idea came from Bacon and other advocates of experimentalism against Descartes thesis, but Vico put this at the center of his philosophy. He believed that in humans there is not only rationality, but also feelings and fantasy. He anticipated Romanticism and Enlightenment, and gave a basis for the social sciences: in his historical analysis he included class struggle before Marx and described history as an spiral in which no stage is repeated, but similar sequences appear as recurrent.
